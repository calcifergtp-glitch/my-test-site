<p>Convection ovens also circulate hot air but are larger and more versatile for various cooking methods.</p>

<p>Air fryers typically cook food faster due to their compact size and efficient heat circulation.</p>
<p>Convection ovens may take longer, especially for larger quantities, but can accommodate more food at once.</p>
<h2>Health Considerations</h2>
<p>Both appliances can reduce fat content in meals by requiring less oil compared to traditional frying.</p>
<p>Air fryers are often marketed as healthier options for crisping foods without deep frying.</p>
<h2>Cost and Size</h2>
<p>Air fryers are usually less expensive and take up less counter space.</p>
<p>Convection ovens can be pricier and require more kitchen real estate but offer greater cooking capacity.</p><h2>FAQ</h2>
