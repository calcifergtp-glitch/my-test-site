  <h1>Air Fryer vs Convection Oven: Which is Better?</h1>
  <p class="small">Published 2025-08-31</p>
  <h2>Cooking Method</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air around food using a fan, creating a crispy exterior similar to frying.</p>
<p>Convection ovens also use a fan to circulate hot air but generally have a larger cooking space, suitable for bigger meals.</p>
<h2>Cooking Time and Efficiency</h2>
<p>Air fryers typically cook food faster due to their concentrated cooking space and high heat.</p>
<p>Convection ovens may take longer but can cook multiple dishes at once due to their larger capacity.</p>
<h2>Versatility</h2>
<p>Air fryers excel at frying, roasting, and baking smaller portions.</p>
<p>Convection ovens are more versatile for baking, roasting, and broiling larger meals.</p>
<h2>Health Considerations</h2>
<p>Air fryers use significantly less oil than traditional frying methods, making them a healthier option.</p>
<p>Convection ovens also reduce oil usage compared to conventional ovens, but not as dramatically as air fryers.</p><h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Can I use aluminum foil in an air fryer?</h3>
<p>Yes, but ensure it doesn&#x27;t block airflow or touch the heating element.</p>
<h3>What is the average price difference between the two?</h3>
<p>Air fryers typically range from $50 to $300, while convection ovens are usually $100 to $500.</p>
